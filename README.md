## What Does This App Do?

This tool extracts pallet information from a pre-formatted Excel file (with data in specific cells) and converts it into a JSON file for easy digital use or integration with other systems.

- **Input:** An Excel file (.xlsx or .xls) with pallet data in fixed cell locations (see below).
- **Output:** A JSON file containing the extracted pallet and build details.

## Excel Input Format

The app expects data in specific cells (row/column) of the Excel sheet. Example mapping:

- PalletID: A18
- Length: B18
- Width: C18
- Delivery: B20
- Notched: B21
- HT: B22
- Type: B23
- Build details (TOP, MIDDLE, BOTTOM): rows 27, 29, 31 (columns Bâ€“L)

If your Excel file does not match this format, the conversion may not work correctly.
